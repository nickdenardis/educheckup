              <dd>If you do any adaptive layout at all focus on the desktop and the smartphone sized screen. Add an extra style sheet for the small screen and make modifications to at the bare minimum remove any requirement for :hover states and position everything vertically. This way at least items can be clicked on and the users isn't forced to pinch zoom every time they visit a new page.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Having easter eggs on your site can make your visitors feel special as the stumble on them. An easy one is using keyboard shortcuts. Although not every user is going to find and use them, the ones that do will probably be delighted.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>Having URL's that describe the content on the page are just as important as the title of each page. "Human Friendly" URL's not only give the visitor confidence they are on the right page they also give search engines a better reason to index your pages. "/academics/accounting" is much clearer that "page.php?id=9847". Everything on your site should build confidence, even the URL.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>It's a pet peeve of mine that designers and developers miss low hanging fruit. The lowest of them all is increasing the clickable area for actionable items. If the goal is to get the user to click make it as easy as possible. Requiring the user to think for even just a few milliseconds about where to click may be just enough to loose them. Try it for yourself, install heat mapping software on your page, you'll be surprised by the results. People click on some crazy things.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>Consistency matters. When a user starts browsing a website they are really looking for trust. If all of a sudden they land on a part of the site that has a different style they have to re-learn to trust the quality of the content. Trust isn't automatic, you have to earn it. Make it easy on yourself and your users, don't force them to continuously regain your trust.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Don't try to re-invent the wheel, there are a lot of user constructs already in place on the web and you should rely on them. Using a standard link style, move effect or way to share content builds familiarity for your user and confidence so they know what to expect. The more confident your user is the more likely it is for them to take action.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>If you are planning to use typeface replacement always make sure you choose an appropriate font stack. This will allow users without javascript to be able to see a similar font that is as close as possible to the desired typeface. It also will decrease the amount of change the user sees when the font replacement happens. It won't look like a drastic change, but a slight improvement instead.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>One of the best and cheapest ways to get insights in to how visitors are interacting with a page is to install heat mapping software on the page. Using a tool like CrazyEgg will show how much people scroll and where people click even if the clicks are not on links. These are two things Google Analytics can't show you.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Hover states on elements not only give your website a feel of texture. The feedback tells the user that the element is press-able. It can also catch the users eye as they move their mouse across the site. Something they may have overlooked can jump out if there is a slight color change. One note about mobile, with touch interfaces the hover effect does not function, so make sure you have another way to denote links from non-clickable items.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>If you're going to embed videos on your homepage or as a side promotion item within your site make sure when a visitor clicks to view the video they can watch it in an appropriate size. If you're space is less than 400 pixel wide it is better to use a static image screenshot of your video which links to the full version than to force someone to watch it either really small or full screen. If you can employ a lightbox technique when viewing that is even better.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>If you are going to use photos with news items make sure the photos make an impact for your visitor. Too small and the image won't be useful. Too big and they will take attention away from the title of the event. Creating a balance is essencial to visitor success.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Using a grid system is a great way to keep your design organized. It takes the guessing of widths from your designers and gives the constraints they can work within. It also gives your developers a standard in which to measure everything. Having odd widths scattered throughout your website can distract your visitor from the real calls to action. Keep it simple, there is no need to reinvent the wheel every page.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Always be designing for the next step. Every page on your website should be designed around where the user should be going next. Dead ends mean lost opportunities. Not only with the visitors current browsing session but it cuts their experience short. You couldn't imagine leaving a perspective student hanging on the phone, email or in person without asking if you could help them further. The same applies online.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>When possible use the built in browser functionality. The native browser functionality is not only quicker but will work with any device that interfaces with the browser. Creating middleware with javascript to accomplish the same action could potentially lock users out of using that functionality.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>Dotted underlines may look nice because they are not as jarring to the eye as straight lines but they have another quality about them you may not realize. Users have been trained to "skip" over links with dotted lines because far too often they are used to denote pop-over ads. Although they may look great on your website, their use may have a negative effect with your users.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>It is important to follow the brand guidelines of external companies that you promote on your website. I am thinking social media in particular. There are so many variations of the Twitter logo that it can be difficult to identify it ata times. Adhering to the companies brand standards will ensure your visitors see and identify with that brand more quickly. The last thing you want to do is make your visitor stop and have to think about something on your page when they should be focusing on accomplishing their goals.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Shadows done right can make a world of difference in an website. Far too often shows are used as a way to create "depth" but are kept at the default Photoshop settings which end up making them look bland. A true graphic designer can enhance any site by adding the right amount of shadow to create the feeling of depth and bring a website to life. Make sure you are not using the defaults, everyone and their brother can tell.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Always, always, always validate your form data before checking against the actual database. You should never trust the user, imagine every single person is trying to take advantage of your server. This means having a whitelist instead of a blacklist for content. This means sanitizing all data and casting it to the correct type for the database. It also means, most importantly turning off all public error reporting on production. If the user (or bot) finds an exploit, errors shown on the screen only give them more insight in to their next move.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>
              <dt><a href="/media/episode-293.m4v">University of Northern Iowa - Episode #293</a></dt>
              <dd>Every page on your site should have a primary navigation, this is where your visitors will look first for direction. There can be other menus on the page, but make sure they don't interfere with the primary navigation. Once the visitor makes it past the homepage, the local navigation should take over as the primary and the university overall navigation should take a back seat. Think about each page individually as a landing page, and not as a top down view of your institution's structure.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>
              <dt><a href="/media/episode-292.m4v">Bridgewater College - Episode #292</a></dt>
              <dd>Every field on every form should always have a label pointing to it. The label is the context around the fields purpose. Text on top or to the left of a field is great but if it isn't wrapped in a "label" element then it means nothing.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>
              <dt><a href="/media/episode-291.m4v">University of Maryland University College - Episode #291</a></dt>
              <dd>Javascript should always be included at the bottom of a page. Javascript can only act on the Document Object Model (DOM), the HTML makes up the DOM. Without the HTML being loaded and rendered by the browser the javascript has nothing to work on. Avoid loading the files too early and potentially slow down the rendering of the page by the browser. It might seem like milliseconds, but those add up and your users notice. Moving your javascript to the bottom of the page will decrease visual loading time which in turn will result in more clicks by your users.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>There are quite a few philosophies about which links on a page should open in a new window and which should stay in the same. The largest group believe all links should open in the same window no matter their destination so the user can control their experience. Others believe that only links that are on a separate domain should open in a new window. And the smallest segment believe any link with a different subject should open in a new window. No matter which philosophy you follow, stick to it and be consistent. Personally I am in the first camp.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>It is important to keep your visitor engaged with your website but that engagement must happen on their terms, not yours. Making anything move on a Web page should only happen if the user has acted on something to make it happen. There are a few instances when it is ok to move elements without the user taking action but they must first be justified with real user data. It comes down to the golden rule of the Web, treat users as you wish to be treated.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Creating an internal API is a great way to keep data consistent across campus and off campus. Having a single source of data to read and write from keeps everyone on the same page. Duplicate information isn't just hard to maintain but more importantly can confuse visitors.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>Ensure you have enough contrast between background colors and text. This applies to all areas of your website, not just the main content section. Use a tool like http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Visual design extends beyond the look of your overall template, visual hierarchy of content plays a big role in user experience. Navigating to a page is only half the battle, even less if the user uses Google, finding information on the page is the real reason the page exists. Ensure each page has an appropriate header structure, paragraphs, and lists. Then make sure the calls to action are prominent and go to relevant locations.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>CSS frameworks are great for keeping a consistent codebase throughout multiple sites but should just be considered a starting point. Once the initial site is setup, pull out the elements needed and get rid of the rest. Some frameworks can carry a large overhead that just isn't needed once the site goes to production.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>Try to think of a website that you visit purely to admire the design and don't pay much attention to the content or the goal of the site. I have a feeling you can't think of any or a handfull if you're a Web design and you browse the Web for inspiration. Believe it or not, this is exactly how your visitors see your site. You're site can have a few flaws and no one will notice. As long as the content is relevant, up to date and they can easily navigate to it. Don't get hung up in the thick of the thin details.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>"Losing 80% of your screen space forces you to focus. You need to make sure that what stays on the screen is the most important set of features for your customers and your business. There simply isn't room for any interface debris or content of questionable value. You need to know what matters most." - Luke Wroblewski<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>If an HTML element isn't being displayed on initial page load or isn't required for accessibility, it shouldn't be returned in the initial HTTP response. Any items that are interactive or timed should be built after the fact in a separate request. This will allow the initial page load to be as light as possible and give search engines only pertinent information to index. The user doesn't need to download the extra bits or search engines don't need to index the empty div tag that your site uses to "close" a hidden dialog box.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>Every page on your site has a primary audience. The primary audience of each page may not align with the majority of traffic to that page, and that is ok. Tailor each page to that primary audience and make it easy for them to see and complete actions. If there are options for a secondary or internal audience it is more acceptable to make them take a few extra steps to get to their customized information since they already have an impression and vested interest in your institution. They have a higher threshold of tolerability.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Your entire website should work with and without a mouse. Not everyone uses a mouse and keyboard to navigate the web and you shouldn't penalize people who browse it differently. On a mobile device you might only have touch ability so hover doesn't work. On a mobile phone, depending on the software or hardware keyboard, you may not have an "return" key. As long as you don't rely on a specific piece of hardware your site should work fine on any device. Think progressive enhancement, not graceful degradation.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong></dd>

              <dd>No matter what CMS you use there is no reason to put a link to it or your login page from your homepage or footer. It doesn't add any value to your page and is just another item to distract your user. Secondly, exposing what CMS you use can open your site up to potential security exploits that you may not even be aware of. It is better to be safe than sorry. Your internal audiences should bookmark the login page.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>No one likes filling out forms, including yourself. Try to fill in as much information or require as little information as possible to increase your conversions. Try auto detecting the city, state or zip of a user and pre-populate the fields. Maybe include a "hide optional fields" link on the side that reduces the form length. You already have the user on the page, make it just that much easier to take the next step.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>All content links should look like links as someone is scanning down the page. The user shouldn't have to hover their mouse over text to determine if it is a link. In addition a hover state allows the user to see that an action will happen when they click. Lastly and probably the most important and equally overlooked is the :visited state. Help your users out by coloring visited links a little differently so they don't end up on a page they have already seen unintentionally.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>Having events on your homepage is important, but what is more important is how well those events are targeted to the audience of your homepage. Too many institutions use their homepage as the "catch all" and try to appeal to every single audience. A lot of people do go there, but which ones are interacting? Every institution is different but my bet is those prospective students. Try to target your events to them and track their effectiveness in click throughs, RSVP's and time on site. You might be surprised about what you find.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

Too many departments and schools wait till their website is 100% perfect before launching even though the site is 99% done, that last 1% could take an extra two or three months. For your user's sake they probably aren't going to notice those few flaws. As long as the content is there that is what the users are focusing on.

              <dd>Users scroll, it's a fact; otherwise there wouldn't be pages deeper than 700 pixels. Make sure your important elements are above the fold, this includes navigation. Although there may be other things on the page the navigation gives the user a frame of reference about where they are and where they can go. More often visitors are coming directly from search engines which means they have about 10 seconds to decide if this is the right place for them. Navigation is a huge factor in orienting someone on your site, make your visitors see it right away.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>If you decide to use icons on your site be sure to use them consistently throughout. Where ever possible use existing icon constructs so your users don't have to relearn what items on your site mean. For example, on the Denver Seminary site they had very consistent event icons except in one area. When I opened that area I was confused and confusing users is the last thing you want to do.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Keep your users engaged through the entire process. Middlebury did an amazing job with all the related items on the right side of each page and at the bottom of the page. It's these things that surprise your visitors and show them you care enough to provide important related information. Even if the information isn't important it makes the page stickier and gives the user something to explore.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>Don't let marketing copy get in the way of the user's goals. If they clicked to see a list of academic programs they shouldn't be presented with the reasons why they should choose your school. They are already at your site and deciding to see what you have to offer, they don't need anything more. Once they find a program then maybe throw in why that program is right for them but don't put up a hoop to jump through before they can get to the actual information they are looking for.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>The downside of using a single template for every one of your pages is that users coming in need to orient themselves within the first few seconds. If they searched for "Art Education" and they get to a page that doesn't say Art prominently in the header and the images are all generic campus shots they may get confused and leave. You pages should be engaging your students on a personal level. Look at the goals of each page and try to put yourself in the users shoes to see how the images and placement of text would resonate with them.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>If you are going to do something different make sure it is useful. Asbury tried a different css technique to display their menu which attached it to the top of the page as the user scrolled down. They knew that the only thing important at the top of the page is the menu. Why not make it always visible so the user doesn't have to scroll all the way back up. I think they way they did it was elegant and unobtrusive.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>100% width sites are hard to both scan and read. It might sound great that you can get a lot of information on the page but the more information you pack on the page the harder it is for users to digest it. As monitors are getting larger the worse it will look.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>Respect your users control, don't force movement on the page without them first prompting for it. Many site administrators think "adding movement" to a site will make it look updated. The hard truth is it takes longer to update moving than static content, especially if you produce text/image alternatives. That extra time could be the difference of your site getting updated four times a week compared to eight or ten with static content. In the end you may be doing your site more harm.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

Just the total man hours to create all the videos would be overwhelming. But, if done right the reward could be an instant connection between a prospect and your institution.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>Just because your university colors are red and black it doesn't mean those are the only colors you can use. First and foremost make sure your site is usable, scannable and then add your primary colors. As long as you are not going completely off the mark your brand will still come through. A large majority of institution's colors don't translate directly to the web. The best bet is to make sure your colors come through in a rich and professional way, no need to be pixel perfect at the cost of usability.<br />Category: <strong>Visual</strong></dd>

              <dd>When you click on something that rotates it should stop. The user has made a choice, you should respect it. Often there are rotating images on institution home pages, make sure you have the ability to stop any movement to read or look at the images. That stop should stay until the user decides to continue the movement.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

              <dd>Having a global navigation is great but make sure it doesn't interfere with the primary focus of the page. Each page has a purpose and although it is important to be able to get back to global information that should not be the focus of a page. Think locally before globally. Make sure a user who comes in directly from a search engine results page is presented with related information to that page before noticing global items.<br />Category: <strong>Information</strong></dd>

                  Take a minute to look at your site on a mobile phone. Specifically an iPhone or iPod Touch because they are the most popular devices to browse the web. Don't limit yourself to those two devices but make sure your site is usable on them. A large number of people are turning to them as their primary means on browsing the web. If you have a mobile style sheet that is great, if you tailor it to those specific devices, even better. One simple thing you can do is add a "apple-touch-icon" to the
                  <head>
                      of your document to have your bookmark branded on an iPod Touch or iPhone.<br />Category: <strong>Code</strong>
